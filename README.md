## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Redux Toolkit
- CSS Grid, Flex
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) - Compilation tool. 

### What I learned

I learn to apply my knowledge of Redux Toolkit, to access the states between components even in different routes. I create the solution thinking on a route based solution, so to access the info between pages I needed a tool / store section where I can store the info and access it from anywhere.
